Building AI course project 

## Summary
Develop an AI application that analyzes multiple news items from different sources (and different languages) about a specific subject. This way one can get a less biased view about a specific news item. 

## Implementation
After gathering multiple news items about a specific subject the text is analyzed to determine if the news is presented in a positive or negative way. The next step could be to present a scoreboard with an overview of the news items, links to the websites where the news was found and a score: very postive - positive - neutral - negative - very negative - undetermined. 

## Programming language 
The AI solution will be developed in Python.
